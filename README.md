### Problem Statement : Create an responsive infinite scrolling list in react for a fixed array of itms.

#### Spec :

- 1.The app must be a authenticated app. It can accept fake login with details, username: foo, password: bar.
- 2.Post login route is '/home'. This route shows our main list Ul. This page shouldn't be accessible by non logged in users.
- 3.logged in pages must show logout button. On click of this logout it will redirect to the login page.
- 4.There's no need to implement a server for fake login functionality. We're not going to judge you for doing so.
- 5.Ul must be built using react.
- 6.The list is a contact list of user and photo. It can look like this (https://imgur.com/lIMJHGR). This design is just for your reference. Any deviations from this design is fine. There's no need for drop down or drawers. Just a list is sufficient.
- 7.It should look correct at least for a 320x480 sized view-port.
- 8.You can use a static list of users like this (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=500) or use this (https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto) free random user api if you fancy that.
- 9.Initially only load a partial list and when user scrolls to end of page. App shows loading feedback and loads more contacts after a delay of 1 sec.
  You can use any open source lib. That's fine.
